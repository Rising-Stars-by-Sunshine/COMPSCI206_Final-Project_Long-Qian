- **About Me**: I'm a DKU undergraduate student in the class of 2026 majoring in Apllied Math and Computer Science. For my CS experience, I was learning informatics contest when I was in junior high school and I've taken most CS courses required in my track. Besides, I'm researching on topics of reinforcement learning with Professor Luo. About my ECON experience, I have only taken ECON101. However, I'm quite interested in the combination of computer science and economy fields, especially in quantitative finance.
- **Interests**:
   - **Machine Learning**: I'm quite interested in different topics of deep learning such as Natural Language Process and I'm recently doing research on applying transformer to Pick and Delivery Problem.
   - **Quantitative Finance**: This is my favorite topic in the combinition of computer science and economics fields. I'm really interested in using machine learning mechanisms in finacial analysis.

   - **Email**: lq54@duke.edu
- **Final Reflections**: 
  - **Intellectual Growth**: Insights and knowledge acquired.
  - **Professional Growth**: Skills developed and career aspirations.
  - **Living a Purposeful Life**: My journey so far has been marked by a commitment to personal excellence and a desire to contribute meaningfully to society. One of my significant personal achievements includes the development of the "Adaptive Trust Equilibrium" model, which not only showcases my ability to innovate but also my dedication to creating solutions that enhance collective welfare. Looking ahead, my future goals involve continuing to refine this model and exploring its applications in other strategic contexts beyond the Traveler's Dilemma. I am also committed to educating others about the potential of integrating technology with economic theories and aspire to mentor the next generation of thinkers and innovators in this field.
