## Project Information
- **Author**: Long Qian, Majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science, Class of 2026, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Professor Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: This is a submission for the Final Project in [COMSCI/ECON 206 Computational Microeconomics](https://ms.pubpub.org/), Spring 2024 Term (Seven Week - Fourth), taught by Professor Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgements**: I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my instructor and supervisor, Prof. Luyao Zhang, for her invaluable guidance throughout the journey of my research. Her expertise and insight have been the compass that steered this work towards its completion. Besides, I also want to express my appreciation to Guangzhi Su who has provided me with constructive suggestions to improve my project.

## Introduction to the GitHub Repository

The repository consists of two parts: The first is the thinking and ideas generated by the content I study each week (CSEcon and Advance_CSECON), and the second is the final research plan that combines the terminology and techniques I have learned in the course with the exploration of new results and solutions from traditional game theory, showing how these can be applied to innovative social thinking. The Latex folder in the Proposal folder contains the compressed files of my work on Overleaf, and the Colab folder contains the code I designed to implement the proposed game theory solution and its results. The CSEcon folder records my initial discussions on how to integrate economics and computer science, exploring the future benefits of this interdisciplinary approach and what to focus on, from presentations by Nobel and Turing Prize winners to future steps towards achieving these goals. The Advance_CSEcon folder details my experience trying and evaluating two game theory analytical tools, pointing out their limitations and the limitations of Nash equilibria, and proposing solutions. In addition, it reflects on what has been learned in guest lectures at DKU and what these have implications for our unresolved issues in interdisciplinary approaches. In addition to the PS1 part, another job, PS2, also played an important role in promoting the final project. Through the completion of PS2, we had an in-depth understanding of the use of Overleaf and the initial concept of the project. All sections of this course are continuous, and each part helps in preparing for the big final assignment.

- **About Me**: I'm a DKU undergraduate student in the class of 2026 majoring in Apllied Math and Computer Science. For my CS experience, I was learning informatics contest when I was in junior high school and I've taken most CS courses required in my track. Besides, I'm researching on topics of reinforcement learning with Professor Luo. About my ECON experience, I have only taken ECON101. However, I'm quite interested in the combination of computer science and economy fields, especially in quantitative finance.
- **Interests**:
   - **Machine Learning**: I'm quite interested in different topics of deep learning such as Natural Language Process and I'm recently doing research on applying transformer to Pick and Delivery Problem.
   - **Quantitative Finance**: This is my favorite topic in the combinition of computer science and economics fields. I'm really interested in using machine learning mechanisms in finacial analysis.

  - **Intellectual Growth**:

    Throughout this course, my intellectual growth was profoundly shaped by exploring how machine learning can enhance the analysis and resolution of complex social and economic issues in game theory.    This rich understanding emerged from both theoretical exploration and pioneers' projects that demonstrated how machine learning models can be applied to predict behaviors and optimize strategies within the frameworks of game theory.    The integration of these fields allows for precise modeling of decision-making processes and strategic interactions, uncovering new ways to achieve equilibrium and cooperation in various scenarios.    The magic of this interdisciplinary research lies in its ability to bring together analytical rigor and computational power, breaking down traditional boundaries between disciplines to foster innovative, robust, and efficient solutions to societal challenges.    By combining machine learning's predictive capabilities with game theory's strategic insights, this course has opened new avenues for tackling issues like resource allocation, competitive behavior, and cooperative strategies, making the intellectual journey both transformative and practically applicable in real-world settings.
  - **Professional Growth**:

    In this course, my professional growth was significantly propelled by acquiring a unique blend of skills in machine learning, game theory, and blockchain technology.   This interdisciplinary training enhanced my analytical prowess, enabling me to develop and implement complex models and blockchain protocols, which are crucial for ensuring data integrity and transaction security.   I mastered the art of integrating these technologies within game theoretical frameworks, which sharpened my strategic thinking and ethical decision-making.   This skill set not only prepared me for technical roles but also equipped me with the necessary tools for strategic planning and implementation in environments that demand transparency and fairness.   As a result, I crafted a distinctive professional profile that showcases my capabilities to analyze data, design secure and transparent systems, and develop strategic solutions that address both competitive and cooperative economic challenges.   These competencies make me a valuable candidate for roles such as blockchain strategist, or economic policy advisor.   This course has not only broadened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how to apply these skills effectively in the real world, enhancing my adaptability and potential to impact the field dynamically.
  - **Living a Purposeful Life**:

      Envisioning myself as a foundational figure, I aim to be recognized as the pioneer of "Adaptive Game Theory with Blockchain Integration," a groundbreaking approach that merges blockchain technology with traditional game theory. My ambition is encapsulated by the aspiration to win a Nobel Prize or Turing Award, recognized for transforming global economic and strategic interactions by fostering enhanced cooperation and collective welfare. My feature sentence is "Revolutionizing game theory with adaptive, cooperative strategies and blockchain technologythat enhance transparency, trust, and collective outcomes in strategic decision-making". My contributions would span developing a dynamic theoretical framework, applying adaptive strategies to complex societal issues like resource allocation and policy-making, and inspiring a shift from competitive to cooperative strategies. This would not only fulfill my personal intellectual curiosity but also significantly advance human civilization towards a more equitable and sustainable future.
