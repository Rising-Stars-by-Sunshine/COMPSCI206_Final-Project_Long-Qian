- **About Me**: I'm a DKU undergraduate student in the class of 2026 majoring in Apllied Math and Computer Science. For my CS experience, I was learning informatics contest when I was in junior high school and I've taken most CS courses required in my track. Besides, I'm researching on topics of reinforcement learning with Professor Luo. About my ECON experience, I have only taken ECON101. However, I'm quite interested in the combination of computer science and economy fields, especially in quantitative finance.
- **Interests**:
   - **Machine Learning**: I'm quite interested in different topics of deep learning such as Natural Language Process and I'm recently doing research on applying transformer to Pick and Delivery Problem.
   - **Quantitative Finance**: This is my favorite topic in the combinition of computer science and economics fields. I'm really interested in using machine learning mechanisms in finacial analysis.

- **Final Reflections**: 
  - **Intellectual Growth**:

    In this course, I not only expanded my knowledge of computer science, but also learned more interesting knowledge of economics, such as different kinds of equilibrium and games in different situations, including their characteristics and corresponding limitations.  In addition, I learned how economists and computer scientists study the game scenarios of human, which was very interesting to me.  Last but not least, through the study of this course, I realized that it is of great significance to combine the knowledge of economics and computer science and apply it to the research of game theory.  In addition, this research has endless potential to promote the development of human economy and society.
  - **Professional Growth**: Skills developed and career aspirations.
  - **Living a Purposeful Life**:

Envisioning myself as a foundational figure, I aim to be recognized as the pioneer of "Adaptive Game Theory with Blockchain Integration," a groundbreaking approach that merges blockchain technology with traditional game theory. My ambition is encapsulated by the aspiration to win a Nobel Prize or Turing Award, recognized for transforming global economic and strategic interactions by fostering enhanced cooperation and collective welfare. My feature sentence is "Revolutionizing game theory with adaptive, cooperative strategies and blockchain technologythat enhance transparency, trust, and collective outcomes in strategic decision-making". My contributions would span developing a dynamic theoretical framework, applying adaptive strategies to complex societal issues like resource allocation and policy-making, and inspiring a shift from competitive to cooperative strategies. This would not only fulfill my personal intellectual curiosity but also significantly advance human civilization towards a more equitable and sustainable future.
